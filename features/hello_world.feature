Feature: Learn Cucumber
  As a Sofware developer
  I want to learn Cucumber
  So that I can develop in BDD style!

  Scenario: Write Hello World Cucumber
    Given I have a Rails project
    When I write a Hello world Cucumber test
    Then I should be able to run it and see "Hello World" printed on the screen
